# react-fusejs-fuzzy-search

Fuzzy search by keeping the UI layer as abstract as possible.

# For testing locally:

Ensure you have `make` utility installed and run either of the example available
commands (e.g. `make link-example-with-component`), then run the example
(e.g. `cd examples/with/component && npm run start`)
